# Cartpole-Policy-Gradient-PyTorch
A policy gradient network was implemented for the OpenAI Cartpole using the PyTorch framework.

The purpose of this project is to use the concept of Policy Gradient which is under the branch of Reinforcement Learning to allow the OpenAI Cartpole to keep the Cartpole balanced by applying appropriate forces to a pivot point.
